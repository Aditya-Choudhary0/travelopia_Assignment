## Features

1. HTML Structure: I structured the HTML with header, main content, and footer sections. The header contains a navbar for navigation, the main content includes a background image with overlay and a content section, and the footer displays copyright information.

2. Styling: I used CSS to style the layout, navbar, buttons, modal, and footer. I applied a gradient effect to the buttons and a background image with an overlay for the main content section.

3. Functionality: With JavaScript, I implemented a modal that opens when the button is clicked and closes when the close button or anywhere outside the modal is clicked. This provides an interactive element to the website.

4. Responsive Design: I ensured that the website is responsive by using media queries. The navbar collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens for better usability.

5. Content: I added placeholder text and images to represent the content and functionality of the app.

## Design Element

1. Used modal: Using a modal instead of an alert offers a more customizable interface, enabling styling to match the overall design. Modals can convey more information and support interactive elements like buttons and forms, enhancing user interaction. They provide flexibility in presentation and can be optimized for accessibility, ensuring a better user experience overall.

2. Used Gradient color: Gradient colors add visual interest, depth, and dimension to elements, making them more engaging and appealing. They can reinforce brand identity, create smooth transitions between colors, and highlight important interface elements. Additionally, gradients are a popular design trend that can contribute to a modern and stylish aesthetic.

4. The CSS properties -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent; and -webkit-background-clip: text; are used together to create a text effect where the text appears filled with a background gradient or image.
-webkit-text-fill-color: transparent; makes the text color transparent, allowing the background to show through where the text is located.
-webkit-background-clip: text; then specifies that the background should be clipped to the text, meaning it will only be visible where the text is displayed.
Together, these properties enable the creation of visually striking text effects, such as text filled with gradients or images, which can enhance the overall design and aesthetics of a website or application.

5. The max-width: 400px; property sets a maximum width for the modal, ensuring that it doesn't become too wide on larger screens, which could make it harder to read or interact with.
The text-align: center; property centers the content inside the modal, providing a visually appealing and balanced layout.
These optional properties help maintain readability and aesthetics, ensuring a pleasant user experience when interacting with the modal.

6. Used Google font family API to get attractive fonts so that the website becomes more appealing.

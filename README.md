To create this web app, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here are some of the decisions I made:

    HTML Structure: I structured the HTML with header, main content, and footer sections. The header contains a navbar for navigation, the main content includes a background image with overlay and a content section, and the footer displays copyright information.

    Styling: I used CSS to style the layout, navbar, buttons, modal, and footer. I applied a gradient effect to the buttons and a background image with an overlay for the main content section.

    Functionality: With JavaScript, I implemented a modal that opens when the button is clicked and closes when the close button or anywhere outside the modal is clicked. This provides an interactive element to the website.

    Responsive Design: I ensured that the website is responsive by using media queries. The navbar collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens for better usability.

    Content: I added placeholder text and images to represent the content and functionality of the app.
